# The Power Apps Design Patterns

Objective is to make it easier for makers to build design-consistent, performant and accessible Power Apps. To achieve this, you can find

- Curated high-quality component-libraries providing you with a complete set of UI elements ready to be used in your own canvas apps
- Guidance on good coding practices to advance your own development skills
- Inspiration on different UI systems and show the *art of possible*

## Why does it matter?

> Low Code should not mean low standards!

We collected information on our main design goals:

- [accessibility](docs/accessibility.md)
