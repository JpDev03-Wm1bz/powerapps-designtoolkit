## some other ideas

- provide as many properties as necessary and as little as possible
- sort properties by importance (and the same way on each component)
- usage of MD Iconography, i.e. here: https://materialdesignicons.com/
- create easy way to download svg-code / preview icons (probably another app)
- configure icons, so they can be copy&pasted from SVG code to the property
- only use built in colors, calculate Hex colors inside components if needed (svg/html)
- create a dope ready to go example app, which shows all the ideas
- make everything as responsive as possible

## tbd

- no usage of built-in scroll bar (actually not sure, looks / feels better but can't click stuff) ðŸ’¡ idea: instead of making an invisible slider we can create our own scrollbar cpm
