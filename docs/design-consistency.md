One of the core principles of User Interface design is consistency. Consistency in UI design is concerned with making sure elements in a user interface are uniform. They’ll look and behave the same way. This helps constantly prove a user’s assumptions about the user interface right, creating a sense of control, familiarity, and reliability.
